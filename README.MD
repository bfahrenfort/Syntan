# Syntan
The syntax analyzer and assembly generation portion of the semester project for the senior level Compilers course. Dear lord, the sheer amount of wonky impure Haskell in this project has me staggering every time I look over it.

## Description
This program takes tokens and symbols generated by Lexicalli and produces a working assembly file.

### Features:

* Quads as intermediate language
* Syntax for nested `IF`, nested `WHILE`, array indexing, `PROCEDURE`, and compound statements
* Novel solution to the forward reference problem
* Moderate error checking
* Limited optimization of quads
* Full assembly generation including integer I/O

### Compilation:
See DESIGN.MD or use `build.sh`
